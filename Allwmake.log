Building the OpenFOAM-preCICE adapter...

Current OpenFOAM environment:
  WM_PROJECT = OpenFOAM
  WM_PROJECT_VERSION = v1912

The adapter will be built into /home/2as/OpenFOAM/2as-v1912/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib
Additional preprocessor/compiler options: 

If not already known by the system, preCICE may be located using:
  pkg-config --cflags libprecice  = -I/home/2as/spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-skylake_avx512/gcc-8.3.0/precice-2.2.0-bli3gia3w3ac4cexsyijzivtgfwjotgi/include 
  pkg-config --libs libprecice    = -L/home/2as/spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-skylake_avx512/gcc-8.3.0/precice-2.2.0-bli3gia3w3ac4cexsyijzivtgfwjotgi/lib64 -lprecice
